# First-Semester-2D-Game
This repository contains the source code and the necessary text files for my 2D shooting game, Shadow Warrior, which I created as my first semester project in UET. It is developed using C++ and features 1D and 2D arrays. The code includes file handling functionality for saving and loading player data.
